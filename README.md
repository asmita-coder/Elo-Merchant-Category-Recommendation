# Elo-Merchant-Category-Recommendation
A Kaggle competition launched to predict customer loyalty score by Elo brand in Brazil.

Elo, a payment brand in Brazil, wants to attract customers that will use their credit or debit
cards more and more. Firstly, they studied the different preferences of its customers in
terms of restaurants, for a period of time, which we will call the training phase. And
recommended new restaurants based on it for some period ahead, which we will call the
evaluation phase. Now, they have tied partnerships with various restaurant merchants to
offer cardholders promotions or discounts. Anytime a user goes to the restaurant Elo has
(recommended) a partnership with, he/she gets an offer or discount if he/she uses its
card for making the said transaction.

Every customer has been assigned a customer loyalty score, which tells how often
he/she makes use of the offers provided to them. How useful are those offers to them?
Finally, after looking at the predicted loyalty score, Elo can then build their various
marketing campaigns around the right segment of customers and maximize a good
customer experience. Understanding the transactional habits of its customers, Elo can
then find the best opportunities to provide to its customer, reduce unnecessary
campaigns, and also improve the customer experience.
